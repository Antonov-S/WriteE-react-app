      <h2>Our Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
      <p className="lead text-muted">You may use the Services only if you agree to form a binding contract with WriteE and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction. In any case, you must be at least 13 years old, or in the case of Periscope 16 years old, to use the Services. If you are accepting these Terms and using the Services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so and have the authority to bind such entity to these Terms, in which case the words “you” and “your” as used in these Terms shall refer to such entity.</p>
      <p>You retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Services. What’s yours is yours — you own your Content (and your incorporated audio, photos and videos are considered part of the Content).</p>
      <p>You represent and warrant that you have, or have obtained, all rights, licenses, consents, permissions, power and/or authority necessary to grant the rights granted herein for any Content that you submit, post or display on or through the Services. You agree that such Content will not contain material subject to copyright or other proprietary rights, unless you have necessary permission or are otherwise legally entitled to post the material and to grant WriteE the license described above.</p>
      <h3>Before you scroll, read this... Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>It’s really hard to make everyone happy with a Privacy Policy. Most people who use WriteE want something short and easy to understand. While we wish we could fit everything you need to know into a Post, our regulators ask us to meet our legal obligations by describing them all in a lot of detail.</p>
      <p>With that in mind, we’ve written our Privacy Policy as simply as possible to empower you to make informed decisions when you use WriteE by making sure you understand and have control over the information we collect and how it’s used.</p>
      <p>So if you skip reading every word of the Privacy Policy, at least know this: WriteE is a public platform and We collect some data about you</p>
