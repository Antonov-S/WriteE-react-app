## About

This is **fullstack app**, focused mainly on the frontend with modern React, therefore some of the other elements in it are pretty basic - the backend is a dummy api created for educational purposes, used html and css are from free social-network theme, etc...

**Note:** The latest stable version of the application can be found at the following [address](https://capable-crumble-2a2ca0.netlify.app). **The backend is hosted on free thier Heroku service**, so if the app doesn't receive any traffic in 1 hour goes to sleep and when someone accesses it takes time to wake up. This causes a short delay for this first request, but subsequent requests will perform normally.
